## Features
Features

- **Direct poolmining**
  You are mining directly with a pool. All Coins are paid by the pool, we are not a man in the middle.

- **Verifiable progress**
  All numbers and values are checkable with third parties. You can verify your pool balance on the website of your pool, so myMiner cannot show any fake data and mine secretly in favor of someone else.

- **No login or registration**
  For real mining you never need any account. You only need a Wallet-Address, which is generated by myMiner. If you already have a Wallet-Address, you can use it, of course. 

- **GUI with wallet- and poolbalance**
  There are even more information regarding your mining devices in expert mode. 

- **Up-to-date exchange rates**
  To find the most profitable Coin, myMiner looks up exchange rates regularly.
